# RimWorld Modding Learning Notes

---

## What's this repo doing?

I love RimWorld, especially it's capable of running thousands of mods to enrich the in-game experience. I love writing codes, it would be great if I could write code for my loved game. I'm creating this repo to record things I learned in my journey.

## Learning Resource

- [https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Modding_Tutorials](https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Modding_Tutorials) This is a good starting point. 
- [https://github.com/roxxploxx/RimWorldModGuide/wiki](https://github.com/roxxploxx/RimWorldModGuide/wiki) Covering more useful concepts and mechanisms of the game.
- [https://spdskatr.github.io/RWModdingResources/](https://spdskatr.github.io/RWModdingResources/) A community-collated hub for all things RimWorld Modding.

## Project Setup
Found a good template on Github to start your mod at [https://github.com/Rimworld-Mods/Template](https://github.com/Rimworld-Mods/Template) I think this one is better than the dotnet template one mentioned in the RimWorld Wiki Tutorials.

Starting your mod by cloning that public template, add/remove folders based on your needs.
